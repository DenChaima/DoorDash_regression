# DoorDash_regression
Build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a Doordash delivery.


## Project's steps:

- Part 1:
  - Data import + check
  - Feature creation
  - Encoding categorical features
  - Handling missing data
- Part 2:
  - Check for collinearity and correlation
  - Feature engineering
  - Check for multicollinearity
- Part 3:
    - Features selection: Random Forest and PCA
    - Feature Scaling
- Part 4:
  - Train different models with different set of parameters to make predictions.
